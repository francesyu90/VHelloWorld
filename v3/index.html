    Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43277705/vuejs-difference-between-computed-property-and-watcher

    methods: 
        -   when you want to alter a component’s state or 
        -   when an event has occurred that isn’t necessarily related to the instance data being mutated

    computed properties:
        - when you want to mutate a property that is dependent upon another property being changed
        - always run synchronously

    watchers:
        when you need to perform some logic as a result of a change that took place on a specific data property
